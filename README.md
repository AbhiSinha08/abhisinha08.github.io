# Portfolio
A Personal Portfolio website built with TailwindCSS and vanilla JS.
 

&nbsp;
## Making this portfolio your own:
All the data on the webpage is generated from json files through JavaScript.  
To make this your own portfolio website, simply clone this project and edit corresponding json files and resume pdf in ```/data``` directory  
Additionally, paste all your required images in the ```/data/images``` and rename them accordingly.
#### A few details like the short intro on home page and contact details are coded directly into the html as of now... will update to dynamically generate these from a json file soon...
